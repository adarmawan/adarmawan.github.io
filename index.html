  # <a name="top"></a>Arief Darmawan's AI Experiments
  These are my publicly available tools based on LLM AI technology. Mostly mini extracts from my other full size projects. I'm mostly a backend engineer, so don't expect much with the frontend stuff.
  
  I've been experimenting with LLM since 2022 with davinci-003 and currie-001. 
  
  I am 46 years old. Have been bitten by programming bug since 5th grade. Never stop experimenting since then. 
  I have been a profesional developer since 2002. I've wore many hats. Currently wearing a tech-lead hat :)
  
  My current developments languages: C#, JS, HTML.

  This is a tool to convert processes, source code of a function and others to MermaidJs notation. Also included a simple MermaidJs previewer.
