# Arief Darmawan's AI Experiments
These are my publicly available tools based on LLM AI technology. Mostly mini extracts from my other full size projects. I'm mostly a backend engineer, so don't expect much with the frontend stuff.

I've been experimenting with LLM since 2022 with davinci-003 and currie-001. 

I am 46 years old. Have been bitten by programming bug since 5th grade. Never stop experimenting since then. 
I have been a profesional developer since 2002. I've wore many hats. Currently wearing a tech-lead hat :)

My current developments languages: C#, JS, HTML.

## Currently available experiments
- AI Mermaid Graph Generator
- AI Persona With Long-term-memory and Knowledgebase
- AI Book Writer
- AI Essay Expert
